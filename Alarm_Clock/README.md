What it does?
It is an alarm and can show time even when Arduino isnt connected with Laptop/Computer, DS3231 module has a 3V battery inside it, which it uses for electricity.

ill add circuit diagram also whenever I get time

1. Arduino (An Arduino UNO was used for this project)
2. 16X2 LCD
3. DS3231 RTC Module
4. Buzzer
